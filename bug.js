This React Native bug arises when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, specifically when dealing with complex data structures like objects or arrays.  The issue manifests as unexpected data corruption or inconsistent data retrieval, where the stored data doesn't match the retrieved data.  The problem stems from AsyncStorage's limitation of only storing strings; therefore, complex objects or arrays need to be stringified (e.g., using JSON.stringify) before storing and parsed (e.g., using JSON.parse) after retrieval. Errors can occur if the stringification or parsing process fails due to invalid JSON or data type mismatches.
